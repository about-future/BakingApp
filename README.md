# BakingApp

### Description
Productionize an app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. This involves finding and handling error cases,
adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

### Why this Project?
As a working Android developer, we often have to create and implement apps where we are responsible for designing and planning 
the steps we need to take to create a production-ready app. Unlike Best Movies where we had an implementation guide,
it will be up to us to figure things out for the Baking App.

### What did I learn?

- Add a widget to my app experience
- Leverage a third-party library in my app
- Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets
- UI Test using Espresso
